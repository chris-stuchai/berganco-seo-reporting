### ⚠️ Database Connection
**Status:** NEEDS CONFIGURATION ⚠️

**Issue:** DATABASE_URL in local `.env` appears to have placeholder value

**Solution:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click your **PostgreSQL** service (🐘 icon)
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Find **DATABASE_URL**
5. Click the eye icon 👁️ to reveal it
6. Copy the entire value
7. Update your local `.env` file:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app:5432/railway"
   ```
   (Paste your actual Railway DATABASE_URL)

**OR** if you want to test on Railway instead:
```bash
railway run npm run migrate
railway run npm run collect backfill 7
```

## ✅ What's Working

1. ✅ **Google OAuth Setup** - Complete and verified
2. ✅ **Google Search Console API** - Connected and retrieving data
3. ✅ **Local Environment** - All variables configured
4. ✅ **Railway Deployment** - Domain: web-production-1d574.up.railway.app

## ⚠️ What Needs Attention

1. ⚠️ **Local Database Connection** - Need Railway DATABASE_URL in local .env
   - OR run data collection directly on Railway

2. 🔄 **Verify Railway Variables** - Make sure all variables are set in Railway:
   - Google OAuth (Client ID, Secret, Refresh Token)
   - GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI (should be Railway domain)
   - SMTP email settings
   - DATABASE_URL (auto-created)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix Local Database (For Local Testing)

1. Get DATABASE_URL from Railway
2. Add to local `.env`
3. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
4. Test collection: `npm run collect backfill 7`

### Option 2: Use Railway (Recommended for Production)

1. Run migrations on Railway:
   ```bash
   railway run npm run migrate
   ```

2. Collect data on Railway:
   ```bash
   railway run npm run collect backfill 30
   ```

3. Generate test report:
   ```bash
   railway run npm run report
   ```

4. View dashboard:
   https://web-production-1d574.up.railway.app
