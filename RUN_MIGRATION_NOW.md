# Run Migration Now - Railway Web Interface

Since `railway run` isn't connecting to the database properly, let's run it directly on Railway:

## Method 1: Railway Shell/Console (Easiest)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app
2. **Select your project** (distinguished-balance)
3. **Click on your web service** (not the database)
4. **Look for one of these options:**
   - "Shell" tab/button
   - "Console" tab/button  
   - "Terminal" button
   - Or click on the latest deployment â†’ look for "Shell" or "Terminal"

5. **Once in the shell, run:**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate-berganco
   ```

The script will automatically find your admin user (chris@stuchai.com) and migrate everything.

## Method 2: Via Railway CLI Shell

Try this command:
```bash
railway shell
```

Then once inside Railway's shell, run:
```bash
npm run migrate-berganco
```

## Method 3: Trigger via API Endpoint

I can also create an API endpoint that triggers the migration when you visit a URL. Would you like me to do that?

**After running, you should see:**
```
âœ… Site created: www.berganco.com
âœ… Updated X daily metrics
âœ… Updated X page metrics
âœ… Updated X query metrics
âœ… Updated X weekly reports
âœ… Migration Complete!
```

Then verify in your dashboard that all data appears! ðŸŽ‰
