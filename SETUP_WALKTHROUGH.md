## Step 3: Configure Your Local .env File (2 minutes)

Now let's add all the variables you've collected to your `.env` file.

### A. Open Your .env File

```bash
cd "/Users/chris/BerganCo SEO Reporting"
nano .env
# OR use your favorite editor (VS Code, etc.)
```

### B. Fill In Your Variables

Replace the values with what you collected:

```env
# Database - We'll get this from Railway next
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/berganco_seo"

# Google OAuth2 Credentials (from Step 1)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="paste-your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="paste-your-client-secret-here"
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback"

# Google Refresh Token (we'll get this in Step 4)
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=""

# Website to monitor
SITE_URL="https://www.berganco.com"

# Resend Email (from Step 2)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_paste-your-resend-api-key-here"

# Email Configuration
REPORT_EMAIL_TO="your-client@berganco.com"
REPORT_EMAIL_FROM="seo@yourdomain.com"
# OR for testing: REPORT_EMAIL_FROM="onboarding@resend.dev"

# Server
PORT=3000
```

### C. Save and Close

Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano, or Save in your editor)

**‚úÖ You now have:**
- ‚úÖ Most variables configured in `.env`
- ‚è≥ Still need: `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` (next step)
- ‚è≥ Still need: `DATABASE_URL` (from Railway)

---

## Step 4: Get Google Refresh Token (3 minutes)

The refresh token is needed for the app to automatically authenticate with Google Search Console API.

### A. Run the Setup Script

```bash
cd "/Users/chris/BerganCo SEO Reporting"
npm run setup
```

### B. Follow the Prompts

1. **You'll see a URL like this:**
   ```
   Step 1: Visit this URL to authorize the application:
   
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?...
   ```

2. **Copy and open this URL in your browser**

3. **Authorize the App:**
   - You'll see "BerganCo SEO Reporter wants to access your Google Account"
   - Make sure you're signed in with the Gmail account you added as a test user
   - Click **"Continue"** or **"Allow"**
   - You might see a warning about "unverified app" - click **"Advanced"** then **"Go to BerganCo SEO Reporter (unsafe)"**

4. **Get the Authorization Code:**
   - After authorizing, Google will redirect you to `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback?code=...`
   - **Your browser might say "can't connect"** - that's OK!
   - **Look at the URL bar** - you'll see something like:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback?code=4/0AeanRr...
     ```
   - **Copy the entire code value** (everything after `code=`)

5. **Paste the Code:**
   - Go back to your terminal
   - The script is waiting for: `Step 2: Enter the authorization code from the redirect URL:`
   - Paste the code you copied
   - Press Enter

6. **Get Your Refresh Token:**
   - The script will exchange the code for tokens
   - You'll see:
     ```
     ‚úÖ Success! Add this to your .env file:
     
     GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN="1//0gxxxxxxxxxxxxx..."
     ```

7. **Add to .env:**
   - Open your `.env` file again
   - Find the line: `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=""`
   - Replace the empty string with the token (including the quotes):
     ```env
     GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN="1//0gxxxxxxxxxxxxx..."
     ```
   - Save the file

**‚úÖ You now have:**
- ‚úÖ `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` configured

**‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:**
- **"Invalid redirect URI"**: Make sure you added `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` in Google Cloud Console
- **"Access blocked"**: Make sure your Gmail is in the test users list
- **Can't see redirect URL**: Check your browser's address bar, even if page shows error

## Step 5: Railway PostgreSQL Setup (5 minutes)

### A. Create Railway Account / Login

1. **Go to Railway:**
   ```
   https://railway.app
   ```

2. **Sign up or Login:**
   - Click "Login" or "Start a New Project"

   - Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
   - Authorize Railway to access GitHub (if first time)
   - Find and select: **`chris-stuchai/berganco-seo-reporting`**
   - Railway will automatically start deploying

### C. Add PostgreSQL Database

1. **Add Database:**
   - In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
   - Select **"Database"**
   - Choose **"Add PostgreSQL"**
   - Railway will create the database (takes ~30 seconds)

2. **Get Database URL:**

   - Go to the **"Variables"** tab
   - You'll see a variable called **`DATABASE_URL`**
   - Click the **eye icon** üëÅÔ∏è to reveal it
   - It will look like:
     ```
     postgresql://postgres:password@containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app:5432/railway
     ```
   - **Copy this entire value**

### D. Add DATABASE_URL to Railway Environment Variables

1. **Go to Your App Service:**
   - Click on your main service (not the PostgreSQL one)
   - Go to **"Variables"** tab

2. **Add All Environment Variables:**
   Click **"+ New Variable"** and add each one:

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
   - For `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, you'll need to update it once you know your Railway URL
   - Add them one by one (click "+ New Variable" for each)
   - Make sure to match the exact variable names (case-sensitive)

**‚úÖ You now have:**
- ‚úÖ Railway project created
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database added
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL` from Railway
- ‚úÖ All environment variables in Railway

## Step 6: Update Google Redirect URI for Production (2 minutes)

Once Railway gives you your production URL, you need to add it to Google Cloud Console.

### A. Get Your Railway URL

1. **In Railway:**
   - Go to your app service
   - Click **"Settings"**
   - Scroll to **"Domains"**
   - Click **"Generate Domain"** (or use a custom domain)
   - Copy your URL (e.g., `berganco-seo.up.railway.app`)

### B. Add to Google Cloud Console

1. **Go back to Credentials:**
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   ```

2. **Edit Your OAuth Client:**
   - Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Click the **pencil icon** ‚úèÔ∏è to edit

3. **Add Production Redirect URI:**
   - Under "Authorized redirect URIs", click **"+ Add URI"**
   - Add: `https://berganco-seo.up.railway.app/oauth2callback`
   (Replace with your actual Railway URL)
   - Click **"Save"**

   - Edit `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`
   - Change to: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/oauth2callback`
   - Save

**‚úÖ You now have:**

## Step 7: Run Database Migrations (1 minute)

Once Railway is deployed, run migrations to create the database tables.

### A. Via Railway Dashboard

1. **Open Railway Service:**
   - Click on your app service
   - Go to **"Deployments"** tab
   - Wait for deployment to finish (green checkmark)

2. **Run Migrations:**
   - Click the **three dots** menu (‚ãØ)
   - Select **"Open in shell"** or **"Open Logs"**
   - Or use Railway CLI (see below)

### B. Via Railway CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in
railway login

# Link to your project (if not already linked)
railway link
# Select your project when prompted

# Run migrations
railway run npm run migrate
```

**‚úÖ You now have:**
- ‚úÖ Database tables created
- ‚úÖ Ready to collect data

---

## Step 8: Collect Historical Data (3-5 minutes)

Now let's pull 30 days of historical data to see when the traffic drop occurred.

### Via Railway CLI:

```bash
# Make sure you're linked to your Railway project
railway link

# Collect last 30 days of data
railway run npm run collect backfill 30
```

This will:
- Pull data from Google Search Console
- Show you exactly when the 50% drop occurred
- Identify affected pages and keywords
- Store everything in your database

**Note:** This might take 3-5 minutes as it pulls a lot of data.

**‚úÖ You now have:**
- ‚úÖ 30 days of historical data
- ‚úÖ Insights into the traffic drop

---

## Step 9: Generate First Report (30 seconds)

```bash
# Generate and send weekly report
railway run npm run report
```

Or test locally first:

```bash
# Test locally
npm run report
```

**Check your email!** You should receive the first weekly report showing:
- Current metrics
- The 50% traffic drop
- Affected pages
- Actionable recommendations

**‚úÖ You now have:**
- ‚úÖ First report generated
- ‚úÖ Ready to send to client

---

## Step 10: View Dashboard

### Local Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open: http://localhost:3000

### Production (Railway):
Your Railway URL (e.g., `https://berganco-seo.up.railway.app`)

**You'll see:**
- Real-time metrics
- 30-day trend charts
- Top pages and queries
- Latest insights
